# AYLIN - Minimal Wordpress Theme

Boilerplate aims to be compatible with a large range of PHP versions, however, still have modern tooling for developing a theme.

What's inside?

- [Webpack](//webpack.js.org/) - Module Bundler
- [SASS](//sass-lang.com/) - a CSS preprocessor
- [Babel](//babeljs.io/) - JavaScript ES6 to ES5 compiler
- [Stylelint](//stylelint.io/) - a SCSS linter
- [Prettier](//prettier.io/) - a SCSS linter
- [ESLint](//eslint.org/) - a JavaScript linter

## Important Prerequisites

### Development Environment

Make sure you have:

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) globally installed.
3. `PHP >= 5.2.4` installed before moving on.

### WordPress

Boilerplate follows a [WordPress Minimal Requirements](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).

1. Read [the WordPress theme development guidelines](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development)
1. Understand [the WordPress template hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com/)
1. Understand [the WordPress Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/)
1. Understand [how WordPress helps with Data Validation/Sanitization](http://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation)
1. Read up on the following WordPress core APIs:
   - [the Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)
   - [the Shortcode API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API)
1. Understand when you should use a Custom Functionality Plugin instead of implementing functionality within a theme
   - [Creating a custom functions plugin for end users](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/02/02/creating-a-custom-functions-plugin-for-end-users)
   - [How to Create a Custom Functionality Plugin (And Why You Need One)](https://www.nutsandboltsmedia.com/how-to-create-a-custom-functionality-plugin-and-why-you-need-one/)
   -

### JavaScript

1. This project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to provide support for modular JS, read up on the functionality & tools it provides

### CSS

1. The boilerplate assumes you are using SCSS to write your styles and compiles to CSS using [Node Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)
2. [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) is used to help you write modern CSS. PostCSS is a very popular tool that allows developers to write CSS pre-processors or post-processors using `Plugins`:
   - [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is used for parsing and adding the correct vendor prefixes to the final generated CSS
   - [PostCSS Preset Env](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env) is used to let you convert modern CSS into something most browsers can understand, determining the polyfills you need based on your targeted browsers or runtime environments.
   - [CSS MQPacker](https://github.com/hail2u/node-css-mqpacker) is used to pack same CSS media query rules into one using PostCSS.
   - [CSSNANO](https://cssnano.co/) is used to minify your CSS and makes code optimizations to have the least amount of code delivered in production.

## Development Guidelines

- Avoid committing the built theme to the project repository
- Avoid committing the `wp-uploads` directory to the project repository
- Avoid making changes directly to the built theme -- Always use the build process
- In production avoid uploading the theme development directory to a public server!
- It is good practice to enable `WP_DEBUG` in your `wp-config.php` file, _but only_ during development. If you use our [Vagrant Dev Environment](https://github.com/code2gether/vagrant-wordpress-dev-environment) setup, its already handled ;)

## Standard Theme Development Process

## Installation and Setup

1. Install WordPress and clear it of unnecessary default themes & plugins. If you use our [Vagrant Dev Environment](https://github.com/code2gether/vagrant-wordpress-dev-environment) setup, skip this line.
2. Clone/Download the contents of this repository into a directory in your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory:
   ```bash
    $ git clone -b master git@github.com:code2gether/aylin-minimal-wordpress-theme.git
    # or if you want to change name of project when cloning it
    $ git@github.com:code2gether/aylin-minimal-wordpress-theme.git <my-theme-name> # without the arrows
   ```
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the `my-theme-name` directory:
   ```bash
    cd wp-content/themes/my-theme-name/resources
   ```
4. (**Note:** The next steps **require** nodejs and yarn)
5. Run `yarn` to install all dev dependencies
6. Run `yarn build` to generate the "built theme" for the first time
7. Log in to the admin and enable the `my-theme-name`
8. Start Developing! ðŸŽ‰

### Development

To begin developing your application, make sure you are in `my-theme-name` directory:

1. run `yarn start` to begin the `development` build process that uses Browsersync, Webpack and Node SASS.
2. Develop your theme in the `resources/assets` and `/my-theme-name` directories, the `built assets` will be generated by `webpack` into `dist` directory
3. Optional Stuff:
   - To install any dependency, use `yarn add <module(s)>` to easily manage JS dependencies, then use `import <module> from '<module>';` anywhere in your JS files you want to use them.

### Production

1. Delete files you are not using from inside the `/my-theme-name` directory
2. Make sure to [add a screenshot.png](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Screenshot) to your theme.
3. Before deploying run `yarn build` to generate a `Production` ready version of the built theme
4. Deploy the built theme `dist` directory, _not the `assets` directory_

#### Resources Structure

```bash
resources/
|-- fonts/ # Custom typefaces goes here.
|   |-- .gitkeep
|-- images/ # Put static images here.
|   |-- .gitkeep
|-- scripts/ # Put JS scripts here.
|   |-- main.js
|-- styles/ # Styles goes here.
|   |-- helpers/ # Useful SCSS helpers
|   |-- _global.scss # global style for theme
|   |-- main.scss # Put your custom SCSS modules here
```
