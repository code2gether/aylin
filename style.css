/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately WordPress will require a style.css file located in the theme's root
folder for stuff to work. This file is responsible only for providing theme information that are displayed
in `Apperance > Themes`. Do not write in here any CSS declarations.

However, we will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using Sass.

All Sass files are located in the /assets/scss folder.

Please note that none of your scss files will be compiled to /assets/app.css
in dist folder before you run 'npm run watch' or 'npm run build'.
